# surviveandthrive

The goal of Survive and Thrive is to make any given environment viable not only for a survival start, 
but to accommodate the full breadth of vanilla or modded gameplay. 
This should be achieved with as few features as possible, while providing mod pack developers maximal freedom with configuration.
