To experience the full breadth of vanilla and modded gameplay, a variety of basic resources are required.

Many extreme environments though lack them entirely, often to the point of soft locking any kind of progression.

The goal of Survive and Thrive is to make these resources available, while giving maximum freedom to mod pack developers.

# Features are specific properties of the game environment, that you may want to declare you require. This example declares
