To experience the full breadth of Vanilla and modded minecraft, a variety of basic resources are required.

Many extreme environments lack them entirely, often to the point of soft locking any kind of progression.

The goal of Survive and Thrive is to make these resources available, while giving maximum configurability to modpack developers.
